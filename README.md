# Food Accessibility & Profitability Dashboard

This project delivers a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key metrics related to food accessibility and profitability across multiple African countries. It empowers stakeholders—researchers, policymakers, and agribusinesses—with actionable insights into regional farming trends, crop performance, and resource utilization.

# Key Features
Regional Coverage: Visual breakdown of farming regions across 11 countries including Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.

Farm Type Distribution: Pie chart showing proportions of large-scale (53%), medium-scale (27%), and small-scale (19%) farms.

Crop Sales Analysis: Beans dominate with 95M units sold, dwarfing other crops like barley and banana.

Seasonal Yield Trends: Line graph reveals peak yield in winter (15M units), with sharp drops in other seasons.

Season 1 Crop Activity Table: Detailed metrics on consumption, value, harvest quantity, and sales for beans, barley, and banana.

Land Tenure Insights: Most farms operate on owned land (6K), followed by communal and borrowed land.

Water Source Efficiency: Irrigated major schemes lead in yield (9.7M), followed by rain-fed sources.

Transport Methods: Trucks and walking are the most common, each used by 2.5K respondents.

Sales Channels: Middlemen and agents dominate, with 2.6K transactions, followed closely by other informal channels.
